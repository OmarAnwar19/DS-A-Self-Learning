# General Tree

---

## What is it?

In the data structure, General tree is a tree in which each node can have either zero or many child nodes. It can not be empty. In general tree, there is no limitation on the degree of a node. The topmost node of a general tree is called the root node. There are many subtrees in a general tree. The subtree of a general tree is unordered because the nodes of the general tree can not be ordered according to specific criteria. In a general tree, each node has in-degree(number of parent nodes) one and maximum out-degree(number of child nodes) n.

## Why use it?

Allows us to organize data in a heirachical format, with heavier, or larger nodes being at the top, and representing parents which have descendant nodes.

### Terms

- Node: any element in the tree
- Root Node: the very first/top node in the tree, where everything branches off from
- Leaf Node: a node which has no branches, or sub-nodes

- Parent Node: a node which has child nodes
- Child Node: a node which has a parent node, or originates from a larger node

- Ancestors: any nodes directly connected prior, and vertically to a node
- Descendents: any nodes which originate from another node and are children, or branch directly down from them

- Levels: level 0-n describes the level of the tree from 0 at the top, to any n level at the bottom.
  --> ex: binary tree has n parents, with each one having at max 2 child nodes

### Big O Complexity - time:

Depends on the tree structure.
